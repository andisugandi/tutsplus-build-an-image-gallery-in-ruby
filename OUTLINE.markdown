## 1.1. Introduction

Welcome to the course! In this lesson you'll be given an introduction to its contents and to what you should expect when following its lessons.

## 1.2. Bootstrap the Sinatra Project

The first thing to do in order to accomplish our task is to bootstrap a project. We'll create a simple set of files and folders that will support our entire application.

## 2.2. Showcase the Images

Now that we have the possibility to store images into a database, we can showcase them in a page! We'll do that in this lesson, with a little twist of Javascript into it to make the page sparkle.

## 2.3. Social Features

Our gallery is running along nicely, it would be great if we could share its pictures. That's exactly what we'll do in this lesson: share content through social media.

## 2.4. Authorization

All of the minimum required features for showcasing an image gallery are ready.  But there's still one thing we need to do to prevent malicious behavior: authorization. We'll create a simple way to do it through HTTP basic authentication.
